Module 6 Assignment

This was a cool assignment. We found proved there is correlation between the latitude and max temperature for cities across the world through plotting and statistical analysis in WeatherPy.ipynb. In addition we were able to analyze cities that would be ideal for vacation based on ideal criteria. I chose a humidity level below 75 and cloudiness = 0. In the US, the location that best met this at this moment 10/29/23 around 7-8a EST was on the West Coast, predominantly in CA. Granted, it is very early in the morning there, so it would be interesting to see what the data shows around noon PST.
